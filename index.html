                Are you spilling your drink everytime you take a sip from your cup? Can you not hold your cup still and always spill it? Well, with this new cup design, you will know when to stop filling your cup. The cup also comes with a small hole for your mouth to drink from, so you won't have to worry about your drink spilling on the other side. Furthermore, the cup comes with a small tray to catch the liquid that falls out of the cup.
